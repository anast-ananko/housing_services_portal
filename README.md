## 1. Overview

The **Housing Services Portal** is an online platform designed to facilitate housing-related service requests for residents. Its primary goal is to streamline communication between residents and housing management while ensuring transparency around service availability and costs.

### ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

- Allow residents to browse and request housing-related services (e.g., plumbing, maintenance, pest control).
- Inform users whether the service is covered under their housing fee or incurs an additional cost.
- Provide clear cost breakdowns when applicable.
- Offer administrators tools to manage services, pricing, and housing package inclusions.
